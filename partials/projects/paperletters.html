        <h1>Story</h1>
        <p>
            This is a project that encompasses several of my hobbies. As I started getting more into woodworking (and getting better),
            my wife suggested that I come up with a logo that I could burn into my projects, as a way of literally putting my brand on them.
            I, of course, jumped at the idea.
        </p>

        <p>
            I came up with a few design constraints and started brainstorming.
            I basically wanted to tie together my name with my hobbies.
        </p>
        <h4>Logo needed to have:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>My name or initials</li>
            <li>Origami element</li>
            <li>Woodworking element</li>
            <li>Code element</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I finally arrived at a design that I really liked.
        </p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-offset-3 col-xs-6 col-sm-offset-4 col-sm-4">
                <div class="thumbnail">
                    <img src="assets/paperletters/firstDraft.svg">
                    <div class="caption">
                        <p>First 'final' draft</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            The logo is my initials (AM) folded together from a single strip of paper.
            As far as representing my hobbies, its all in there, though at different levels of subtlety.
            The origami element is obvious in the folded strip.
            The woodworking element comes from my original motivations (and you know, when its actually burned into wood).
            The code element comes from how I designed it.
        </p>
        <p>
            At first, I designed the logo mostly on the computer using my intuitions about what folds look like.
            After looking at it for a while though, the angles started to bother me so I decided to make a physical prototype.
        </p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-offset-3 col-xs-6 col-sm-offset-4 col-sm-4">
                <div class="thumbnail">
                    <img src="assets/paperletters/logoPaper.png">
                    <div class="caption">
                        <p>Paper prototype</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            I then realized that in order to get the right angles on the computer it would take some maths and geometry.
            So I naturally wrote a program that would allow me to draw any shape with strips. Below is an embedded live demo.

        <h1>How does it work</h1>
        <p>
           The first thing I did was to come up with a list of design constraints, or "must haves":
        </p>
        <h4>Design constraints:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The resulting shape has to physically correct</li>
            <li>Unfolding animations have to look plausible</li>
            <li>It all has to be in SVG for use in a website</li>
            <li>It has to look good, and like paper</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Below I go into a bit more detail on how some of the math behind this works.
        </p>
        <h3>Lines to folds</h3>
        <p>
            The first thing I did was to figure out how to go from a set of connected points to folded strips.

        </p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-offset-1 col-sm-10">
                <div class="thumbnail">
                    <img src="assets/paperletters/linesToFolds1.svg">
                    <div class="caption">
                        <p>From to connected points to folded strip</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            First, we have to figure out the angle at which the paper will fold, given location of the desired points.
            A key observation here is that this behaves the same as a 2D reflection. Another way to look at is that the
            fold is tangent to the folding point, and the same distance from both lines.
        </p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-offset-1 col-sm-10">
                <div class="thumbnail">
                    <img src="assets/paperletters/linesToFolds2.svg">
                    <div class="caption">
                        <p>Sum of the interior and exterior angles is 180 degrees.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            This means that the angles in yellow are the same, and when added to the blue angle the total is 180 degrees.
            We can figure out what the blue angle is with the dot product. Now that we have the angle, we need to figure out
            how long the segment around the fold point is. There are many ways to do this, but the way I did it involves some simple
            triangle geometry.
        </p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-offset-1 col-sm-10">
                <div class="thumbnail">
                    <img src="assets/paperletters/linesToFolds3.svg">
                    <div class="caption">
                        <p>Closeup around a fold point</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Since we know angle \(a\) (from the previous step), and length \(w\) (which is just half of the desired strip width),
            we can calculate angle \(b = 180 - (90 + a)\). We can then use the definition of \(cosine = {adjacent \over hypotenuse}\).
            Then plug in our values and solve for \(h\) and we get $$h = { w \over cos(b)}$$ The final code looks something like the following.
            In the snippet, "this" refers to the fold point:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code class="language-javascript" prism>

    calcFold: function () {
        if (!this.prev && !this.next) {
            return;
        }
        var angle;
        var dir;
        if (this.prev) {
            dir = this.prev.point.subtract(this.point).norm();
        } else {
            dir = this.point.subtract(this.next.point).norm().scale(-1);
        }
        var cross;
        if (this.next && this.prev) {
            var otherDir = this.next.point.subtract(this.point).norm();
            angle = (Math.PI - dir.angle(otherDir)) / 2;
            cross = dir.cross(otherDir);
            if (cross > 0) {
                angle = -angle;
            }
        } else {
            angle = AM.Math.ToRad(90);
        }
        var size = $width / (Math.cos(AM.Math.ToRad(90) - angle));
        var foldA = dir.rotate(angle).scale(size);
        var foldB = dir.rotate(angle).scale(-size);
        this.fPointA = this.point.add(foldA);
        this.fPointB = this.point.add(foldB);
    }
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            Now we have all the required points and can draw a series of overlapping trapezoids to come up with the folded strip.

        <h3>Unfolding</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-offset-1 col-sm-10">
                <div class="thumbnail">

        <p>
            As illustrated above, the corresponding unfolded points can be found by reflecting the folded endpoints
            about the folding line. Vector projection can be found with the dot product, \(\vec{a}_{||b}=\vec{a} \cdot \hat{b}\).
            If we have a vector to point  \(\vec{p}\) and a line \(\vec{a} +t\hat{n}\), then the projected portion that we want is
            \(((\vec{a}-\vec{p}) \cdot \hat{n})\hat{n}\) and the vector from \(\vec{p}\) to the line is then
            \((\vec{a}-\vec{p})-((\vec{a}-\vec{p}) \cdot \hat{n})\hat{n}\)
